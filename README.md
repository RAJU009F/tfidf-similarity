# tfidf-similarity
The Luigi pipeline should contain the following tasks  Parse/Cleanup - This step should parse the documents.txt file and remove any punctuation Compute TF - This step should compute the term-frequency for each term in each document. Compute IDF - This step should compute the inverse document frequency for each term Compute TF-IDF - This step will compute the TF-IDF weight of each term in each document Compute Similarity - This step should determine the similarity between all documents by calculating the Euclidian Distance between each TF-IDF vector. Expected output The final output of the pipeline should be a csv with columns corresponding to: Document 1 ID Document 2 ID Similarity Document id is in the index of the document according to the order defined by the input file. Output is ordered from most similar to least. Similarity computed for each pair of documents in the input where document_id_1 &lt; document_id_2
